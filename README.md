# Just Dance Unlimited Asset Downloader (JDUAssetDownloader)

JDUAssetDownloader is a tool for downloading textures, audios and video previews from Just Dance Unlimited servers.

I made this tool for myself but I decided to make it public. This doesn't have the latest SongDB from JDU servers.
I will update this later with making the script update SongDB each time the tool is run.

## Installation & Usage

Just download the zip file from the releases page and run the .bat file. It will download everything under the folder called
"jd-s3.akamaized.net" (which is the URL of the jdu assets) and their original path.

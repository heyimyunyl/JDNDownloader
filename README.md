# Just Dance Now Asset Downloader (JDNDownloader)

JDNDownloader is a tool for downloading textures, audios and video previews from Just Dance Now' old servers.

## Installation & Usage

Just download the zip file from the releases page and run the .py file. If you want to download songs that you want, you can edit the songs.json file by replacing the codenames with case sensitive. It will download everything under the folder called
"songs" and their original path.

If you're getting the error "Missing module 'Requests'"
Open CMD and type ```pip install requests```
